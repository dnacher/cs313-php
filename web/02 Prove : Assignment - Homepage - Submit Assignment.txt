After completing the assignment, please answer the questions in this text file and submit it to I-Learn.

1. Copy and paste the URL for your web application:

https://salty-falls-70357.herokuapp.com/


2. Copy and paste the URL for your source code repository (e.g., GitHub):

https://github.com/dnacher/cs313-php


3. Briefly list and describe the elements of the application that are functioning. Include any special instructions about how to login and/or use your application.

I create the index with 2 buttons. One for the introduction where I create a paragraph and add an image.
the other page is projects where I'm going to put the list of all projects. From now I have only a link to go back to the index page

4. Briefly describe any pieces of the assignment that are not yet working correctly.

I think I did all the things I had to do for the assignment.


5. Briefly describe the "coolest" thing you learned while completing this assignment.

I start working with bootstrap. I think is very interesting how easy to use is.

6. What is the difference between an HTTP Get and Post? When should each be used?

get is to receive information and post is to add information.
we should use get when we need to receive information.
for example if I want to know the information of a user I could do it with get.
If I want to add another user I should use post.


7. Please select the category you feel best describes your assignment:
A - Some attempt was made
B - Developing, but significantly deficient
C - Slightly deficient, but still mostly adequate
D - Meets requirements
E - Shows creativity and excels above and beyond requirements

I don't know if I reach to E but I think is between D and E, because I have all the pages and I use buttons, links and images. I also use bootstrap.
I did some things with css and js

8. Provide a brief justification (1-2 sentences) for selecting that category.

I already did that in the last question.
